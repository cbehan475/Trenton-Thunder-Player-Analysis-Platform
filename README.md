# Trenton Thunder Scouting App

This is a custom web application I built to track and display hitting and pitching data for the Trenton Thunder during the MLB Draft League season. Itâ€™s designed to assist with player development, scouting evaluations, and building game-specific reports.

## Features
- Loads game data from JSON files (by date)
- Displays sortable tables for hitters
- Planned support for pitchers with advanced pitch metrics (IVB, HB, spin)
- Simple, clean UI focused on quick data review

## Future Development
- Dropdown to select individual games
- Split views for hitters and pitchers
- Graphs and visual charts for exit velocity, launch angle, and pitch movement
- Expanded player development notes section

## Why I Built This
I created this app to support my work in scouting and player development, providing an organized way to review game data and highlight key performances.
