    summary: 'Four-pitch RHP with ground-ball sinker (59% GB) and plus-miss sweeper (54% whiff). FB shows ride traits to play north; cutter is fourth. Present strike throwing is fringy on sinker; overall control trending up. Role fit leans multi-inning relief with chance to spot start if future command clicks; FV45, medium risk.'
