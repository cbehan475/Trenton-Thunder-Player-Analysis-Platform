# Trenton Thunder Scouting React App

This is a custom React web application I built to track and display hitting and pitching data for the Trenton Thunder during the MLB Draft League season. It helps support scouting evaluations, player development, and game-specific reports.

## Features

- Loads game data from JSON files (by date)
- Sortable tables for hitters and pitchers
- Pitcher dropdown to select individual pitchers
- Inning dropdown to view specific innings pitched
- Displays advanced pitch metrics: velocity, spin rate, IVB, and HB
- Built with React and Material UI for a clean, modern interface

## Data

- Game JSON files are stored in the `public/data` directory.
- Example files: `hitters-2025-07-06.json` and `pitchers-2025-07-06.json`.

## Why I Built This

I built this app to support my work in scouting and player development by providing an organized way to review game data and highlight key performances.
